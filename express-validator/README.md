an MVC architectured API backend
in NodeJS and MongoDB using Express 
the application  has MVC architecture and  split into separate files 
database should hold two collections: 
Users and Posts because we are making a Blog

created all the needed REST API interfaces for both of these collections
Index endpoints have filters by: 
sortDir and sortBy URL parameters
Used Postman for handing and testing all API endpoints
Used PUT instead of PATCH method for updating 
Having an additional PATCH endpoint will as a Bonus
